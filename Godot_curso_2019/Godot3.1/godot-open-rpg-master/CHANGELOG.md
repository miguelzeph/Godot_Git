## v0.2.0: Better Encounters âš”ðŸŒŸ - 2018-12-01

This version brings a lot of new features and improvements to the project's codebase thanks to the help of @godofgrunts, @nhydock, @salvob41, @MarianoGnu, @henriiquecampos, and @guilhermehto! We did at least twice as much as we planned thanks to everyone's help ðŸ˜„

### New

#### Battle system

- Basic skill system. Allows to create special attacks, magic, etc.
  - CombatAction for skills
  - Simple menu to select CombatActions: Attack, Skill, etc.
  - Skills can be executed on a given probablity
- Character growth
  - Experience points are awarded at the end of battle to gain levels
  - The value of the characters' stats is based on Godot's curves
- Battle Formations for monsters and the player's party, based on .tscn files
- Added support for multiple targets. The interface to do it from the game is not available yet but you can now pass pass multiple targets to any combat action/command and it will affect all of them
- Animated pop-up labels. They show how much damage a character to took or how much mana someone lost. There's also animations ready for healing effects.
- The battlers now have a bounding rectangle based on the RectExtents node: we use it to place the interface or to determine the size of a character

#### Core

- Inventory and items: also manages the party's currency
- Persistent data between the combat and the map: after an encounter, the experience and items the characters earned gets transfered to the Party. This will allow us to add savegame support

#### Map

- Grid-based character movement
  - Follower pawns follow the leader or playable one with a one-step delay
- Dialogue system

#### User Interface

- Mana bars
- Circular menu: a radial menu you can use for battle, for the character to pick one of multiple CombatActions to use on its opponent. E.g. attack, a specific skill...
- Rewards screen: old-school, time-based rewards screen

#### Art

Added sprites for Godette, Robi, the porcupine, and the grasslands battle background sprites. There's also the first combat icon for Robi's base attack, the bilboshot.

None of the art is animated yet.

#### Audio

There is now a battle theme and a placeholder victory fanfare

### Changed

- Added some asserts in the code to help with debugging
